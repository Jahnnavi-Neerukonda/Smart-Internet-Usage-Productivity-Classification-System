# Smart Internet Usage & Productivity Classification System

This project focuses on analyzing internet usage behavior and classifying it as **productive** or **unproductive** using Machine Learning techniques.  
The system aims to help students and professionals understand their digital habits and improve productivity in real time.

The project uses supervised learning models for **classification and regression**, trained on usage data such as website category, time spent, session duration, and access frequency.

## Future Enhancements
- Browser extension for real-time tracking
- Personalized productivity recommendations
- Deep learning–based behavior modeling
- Dashboard visualization using Streamlit
